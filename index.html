        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>While this was a far cry from our initial ideal of a gamified cooking instructional app, Gather did a better job of meeting our user's needs. Our final design was clean, beautiful, and, most importantly, useful to people.</p>
        <h2 id="Problem">Problem</h2>
        <p>People with food allergies have a difficult time finding safe and delicious recipes. The solution? Gather! An app that saves a user's dietary information and only shows them recipes that are safe to cook and eat.</p>
        <h2 id="Research">Research</h2>
        <p>During the empathize phase of the project, I conducted user interviews to build new personas and to inform the design. Together with the team, we prepared an interview script with open ended questions, focuing on our target audience's values, motivations, and daily routines. In two days, I recruited and interviewed three users remotely. We referenced our user interview findings throughout the entire rest of the design process</p>
        <p>What were those findings, you ask? Well, our initial idea was a gameified cooking app that would help new chefs feel confident in the kitchen. Our research, however, led us to an important insight. People who don't cook...don't want to cook. It's not because they can't or don't know how. They like their life of takeout and don't want it to change!</p>
        <p>However, we did discover a user group with an unmet need through our research - people with food allergies constantly feel left out of delicious home cooked meals with friends, and often struggle to find easy, delicious meals that meet their restrictions. We'd found our user and our problem. Now, we just had to develop a solution.</p>

              <p>Meet Erin Richardson! Our user persona borne from hours of research and analysis.</p>
              <p> Each team member drew paper prototypes of our initial, gut-reaction drafts of what our app could look like. We compiled each into a FigJam file and took the best pieces from each person's drafts. We then created a mid-fidelity prototype and began running user testing.  We also drafted a user scenario, journey-map, and user flow to ensure our mid-fidelity prototype would work as smoothly as possible and be responsive to user needs.</p>
              <p>From our mid-fidelity user testing, we learned some key takeaways. We had some functionality issues. We also had some opportunity to iterate and add important features.</p>

              <p>We prioritized some key changes after user testing. First, we updated the search experience. We also added reviews for the user to read. We improved the dietary needs selection process by allowing a user to toggle on and off when choosing their allergies. We also provided more transparency to the user about how their dietary selections are used to enhance their experience within the app.</p>
